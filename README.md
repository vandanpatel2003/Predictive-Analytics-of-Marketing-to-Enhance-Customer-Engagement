## **🚀Feature Engineering🚀**

📊 Introduction to Feature Engineering

In my quest to enhance the success of our marketing campaign, i embarked on a journey through data. Feature engineering was my guiding star, allowing me to uncover deeper insights into customer behavior and boost conversions. 💡

1. **Creating the Conversion Rate📈**
I commenced by calculating the conversion rate, a pivotal metric that measures the percentage of website visitors who responded to our campaign. This served as the foundation for comprehending customer behavior. 🧮 The calculate conversion rate are from:
**Total Responses / Total web visit**

2.   📆**Customer Age Insights**
I segmented our customers into five distinct age groups. This segmentation allowed us to gain insights into the preferences and behaviors of different age cohorts, spanning from children to senior adults. 

3.   💰 **Income Labeling**
We didn't stop at numerical data; we also created a meaningful "Income Level" feature. By categorizing income into four distinct labels—Low Income, Moderate Income, High Income, and Very High Income—we gained insights into spending behavior and purchasing power. 

4.  🕰️ **Unlocking Recency Insights**
Recency is a crucial factor in customer engagement. We segmented customers based on their recency of interaction with our brand. This allowed us to tailor our marketing efforts to customers who were recently active and those who might need a gentle nudge to re-engage.

5.  🛒 **Total Transactions Analysis**
Total transactions give us a comprehensive view of customer engagement. We calculated the total number of transactions for each customer, shedding light on their loyalty and engagement with our products and services. 

6.  👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **Understanding Family Size**
Family size can influence purchasing decisions. We engineered the "Family_Size" feature, providing insights into the composition of our customers' households. This information is invaluable for crafting family-centric marketing campaigns. 

7.  📆 **Recency Grouping**
To further refine our strategies, we grouped customers by recency into distinct segments. This allowed us to tailor our communication and offers based on how recently customers interacted with our brand, ensuring relevance and engagement.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

for this step we gonna investigate more about our data pattern from the distribution numerical and bar graph for categorical data.

* categorical columns = 'ID', 'Education', 'Marital_Status', 'AcceptedCmp1', 'AcceptedCmp2', 'AcceptedCmp3', 'AcceptedCmp4', 'AcceptedCmp5', 'Complain', 'Response'

* numeric columns = 'Year_Birth', 'Income', 'Kidhome', 'Teenhome', 'Recency', 'MntCoke', 'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts',  'MntFishProducts', 'MntSweetProducts', 'MntGoldProds',
'NumDealsPurchases', 'NumWebPurchases', 'NumCatalogPurchases', 'NumStorePurchases', 'NumWebVisitsMonth', 'Z_CostContact', 'Z_Revenue'

## **Data Preprocessing** 

I have executed a robust data preprocessing phase, aiming to prepare the dataset for comprehensive analysis. Let's explore the remarkable steps i've accomplished through a series of powerful actions:

* **Data Cleaning** 🧹:
  
  In the dataset, we have a total of 2240 rows and 29 columns. Notably, the `Income` column contains 2216 non-null values, while 24 values are missing. Rather than imputing these missing `Income` values, we       have chosen to remove the rows with missing data. This approach simplifies the dataset and ensures that only complete and available information is used for analysis. Removing the null data helps maintain the    integrity of the dataset, avoiding any potential bias introduced by imputing missing values with a specific measure.

  The other data cleansing process, we executed two key steps to enhance the quality and relevance of our dataset.

  1. **Removing Duplicate Rows**
  We initially conducted a check for duplicate rows within the dataset. Fortunately, no duplicated rows were identified. Duplicate rows, if present, could lead to inaccuracies in our analysis, and their removal   ensures data integrity.
  
  2. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**
  To streamline our dataset and focus on the most relevant features, we dropped several columns deemed unnecessary for our analysis. These columns, namely `Unnamed: 0`, `ID`, `Dt_Customer`, `Z_CostContact`, and   `Z_Revenue`, were excluded from the cleaned dataset.
  
  By eliminating these columns, we simplify the data structure, making it more manageable and conducive for subsequent analysis and modeling. This step also aids in improving computational efficiency and data     interpretability.

* **Outlier Handling** 🚫:

  The next step data pre-processing journey has uncovered some critical observations regarding outliers in specific columns. Let's break down the key insights:

  **Outlier Identification:** 
  * We've identified outliers in multiple columns, including `MntGoldProds`, `MntGoldProds`, and various spending categories (e.g., `MntCoke`, `MntFruits`).
  * Some of these outliers are exceptionally extreme, such as an `Income` above 600M and `MntCoke` spending above 1.2M.
  
  **Outlier Handling:** 
  * To address these outliers, we applied a log transformation to the data.
  * As a result, we were able to mitigate the impact of extreme values, which is particularly crucial due to our relatively small dataset (2240 rows).
  * This step aligns with best practices for handling outliers, as it avoids the need for data deletion, preserving valuable information.
  
  **Further Steps:** 📜🧹
  * For columns with a large number of remaining outliers, we may consider additional methods or transformations to better understand and manage these data points.
  * Removing outliers based on Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-score could be a next step to enhance data quality.


* **Standardization** 📏:
  Standardization is the process of transforming our numeric features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is essential for ensuring that all numeric features have the same scale,       
  preventing any single feature from dominating the analysis or modeling process.


* **Feature Encoding** 🛠️:
  Feature encoding allows us to work with categorical data effectively. Here's what i've done:
  * We applied One-Hot Encoding to the `Marital_Status` columns. This technique converts categorical variables into binary vectors, making them suitable for machine learning models.
  * For the `Education` column, we performed Label Encoding. This method assigns unique numerical values to each category, preserving the ordinal relationships in the data.



## **Data Modelling**

In the modeling phase, we delve into understanding the inherent structure of the data through clustering techniques. Clustering helps unveil patterns, segment similar data points, and reveal underlying relationships within the dataset.

**elbow Plot Analysis:**

* In our quest for the ideal number of clusters, we conducted an elbow plot analysis.
* The plot revealed a distinct "elbow point" at **K=4**, suggesting that four clusters were a suitable choice for our customer segmentation.
* This decision allows us to strike the right balance between granularity in understanding customer behavior and practicality in tailoring marketing campaigns.

**Silhoutte Score Analysis:**

![image](https://github.com/riyouuyt/Predict-Customer-Personality-to-Boost-Marketing-Campaign-using-Machine-Learning/assets/122600889/c8b5095d-a5fe-4871-9a23-74824303a58f)

As we examined the Elbow Method plot, we observed a significant "elbow" forming at 4 clusters. This suggests that 4 clusters is an appropriate choice, balancing complexity and meaningful segmentation. 
Further validating our choice, the Silhouette Score for our clustering was an impressive 0.62, reinforcing the quality and separation of the clusters we've created. 
Let's move forward and explore how these clusters can power our targeted marketing strategies and elevate customer engagement. 

## **Customer Personality Analysis for Marketing Retargeting**

In our data universe, we've ventured deep into the world of customer behavior, exploring their preferences, habits, and interactions. Our quest is to decipher distinct personalities among these customers, akin to characters in a tale, to tailor our marketing strategies effectively.

The code snippet map_cluster is akin to a legend—a guide that translates the abstract language of clusters into relatable personas. Each cluster is assigned a distinct persona, enabling us to understand and connect with these "characters" in our dataset.

Let's unravel the narrative further:

* **"Low Prospect":** This persona signifies customers with lower engagement, a group that requires targeted nurturing.

* **"Risk of Churn":** Here lies a group displaying signs of potential churn, indicating the need for retention strategies.

* **"Mid Prospect":** These customers exhibit moderate engagement—a promising ground for further exploration and targeted engagement.

* **"High Prospect":** This persona embodies our most engaged customers, representing a goldmine for tailored premium offerings and loyalty programs.

By mapping clusters to these personas, we aim to breathe life into our data, transforming raw numbers into relatable characters. This, in turn, will guide our marketing endeavors, enabling us to create bespoke strategies that resonate with each group's unique personality traits.

### **Barplot for each Cluster Total**
